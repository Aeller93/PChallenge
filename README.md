# PChallenge
Single page application with Angular JS,

Create a small 1 page app using Backbone or Angular. At the top of the page there should be an input field that takes a url. When you insert the url and hit a "Draw" button the app should use ajax to query the given url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aeller93/PChallenge/master/dates.json 

The url will give a json response of data which can be used as a payload and input into an interactive chart using the D3 charting library. The chart should use d3-zoom and d3-brush to make it more interactive.
